# EaseDesk Ticket System

Welcome to the EaseDesk Ticket System repository! 🚀 This project is a testament to my ongoing journey in programming and the pursuit of technical excellence. The primary objective is to create an efficient solution for managing helpdesk tickets, ensuring a seamless experience for users and support agents.

## About the Project

The EaseDesk Ticket System is a dynamic project, continually evolving as I acquire new knowledge and skills. I am dedicated to enhancing code quality, system efficiency, and user experience. Your interest, contributions, and feedback are highly valued as I strive to make this system better with each iteration.

## Latest Changes

🛠️ We're currently in the midst of a significant transition in the database connectivity method. Shifting from the unconventional but simplier `java.sql.DriverManager`  approach, we are embracing JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate. This change is aimed at improving code maintenance, simplifying database queries, and providing greater flexibility in entity modeling.
Thus far, only a portion of the program's logic has been implemented and there is no user interface.
