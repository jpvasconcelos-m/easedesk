# EaseDesk Ticket System

Welcome to the EaseDesk Ticket System repository! üöÄ This project is a testament to my ongoing journey in programming and the pursuit of technical excellence. The primary objective is to create an efficient solution for managing helpdesk tickets, ensuring a seamless experience for users and support agents.

## About the Project

The EaseDesk Ticket System is a dynamic project, continually evolving as I acquire new knowledge and skills. I am dedicated to enhancing code quality, system efficiency, and user experience. Your interest, contributions, and feedback are highly valued as I strive to make this system better with each iteration.

## Latest Changes

üõ†Ô∏è We're currently in the midst of a significant transition in the database connectivity method. Shifting from the unconventional but simplier `java.sql.DriverManager` approach, we are embracing JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate. This change is aimed at improving code maintenance, simplifying database queries, and providing greater flexibility in entity modeling. This program doesn't have user interface yet.
